# php-rs

A minimalistic PHP interpreter.

## Overview

With this project I'm attempting to create a lightweight PHP interpreter built using Rust.
It's currently in its early stages and is meant for experimental and educational purposes.

## Try it out

I've deployed the REPL to the web using WebAssembly (see the `wasm` directory).
A GitHub Action is used to build and deploy it to S3 on every push to the `main` branch.

You can find it [here](https://php-rs.zakfarmer.com).

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional operators / boolean expressions
- First-class functions
- Variable assignment & scopes
- WASM binary

Expect this list to grow üòÅ

## Usage

Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZakFarmer/php-rs.git
cd php-rs
```

To run the interpreter:

```bash
cargo run
```

To run the testsuite:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Credits

The design of the project was heavily influenced by Thorsten Ball's "Writing an Interpreter in Go" and "Writing a Compiler in Go", of course adapted to Rust.
100% recommend reading both as they're great books if you're interested in language fundamentals.

## Contributing

Although this project isn't intended to be anything consequential and certainly won't ever be used in production, contributions for educational purposes or to address small issues are always welcome.
## Disclaimer

This project is an independent work and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the official PHP development team or the PHP Group. The interpreter has been created for experimental and educational purposes only.
